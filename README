** README for implementing peak/pit visibility graphs and distance calculation


These four files should get on started in replicating and understanding the climate analysis in
Hasson et al. A combinatorial framework to quantify peak/pit asymmetries in complex dynamics.
Scientific Reportsvolume 8, Article number: 3557 (2018) 

This example works with climate data and requires
library(ncdf4)
library(moments)

Related files:
1. air.2m.gauss.2015.nc is a sample input file
2. results.2015.topdown.txt is the results file for that year, for sanity checks
3. getVisibilityFunction.r is a function written by Thomas Jagger which constructs a natural VG from a time series

General notes:
For those intending to apply in other domains, the crucial elements are derivation of net1 and net2 
net1 <- get.visibility(testTS) ; # get the visibility of original
net2 <- get.visibility(revTestTS); # get visibility for inverse

pulling the degree distribution
updist <- net1$pk
downdist <- net2$pk

and then creating two new degree distributions that are matched in their maximal bin value
(fill in empty histograms with as many degree slots as max of up or down)

Only at that point is it possible to derive a distance between the two degree distributions.
